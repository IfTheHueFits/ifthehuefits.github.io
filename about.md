# About page

Why Hello there! Nice of you to join us. I'm Ollie, a recent Electrical and Information Engineering graduate from Cambridge and I love all things miniature painting. Collecting warhammer from the lowly age of 7, and actually getting into the painting side of the hobby properly about 10 years later, in these lockdown days its how I am spending most of my time. In fact Warhammer has become such a big part of my life that my final year dissertation project was base on creating a Computer Vision framework that could play (or at least help play) a game of Warhammer. It had limited success but hey if you are interested in the maths feel free to have a look at it here.

Since graduating (althought because of Coronavirus I've technically not graduated yet) I have started as a Trainee Patent Attourney, arguing all things science and the law. I also created this whole website froms scratch so if there are any bugs, or something you think could work better then let me know! Always interested to learn.
