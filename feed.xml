&lt;p&gt;So after how much I enjoyed &lt;a href=&quot;/review/2021/10/17/noki-class.html&quot;&gt;my last class&lt;/a&gt; I could hardly say no when I saw Mamikon announce his face painting one. From last time I already knew that whatever preconceived notions I had of what I was capable of and how I thought the best way to go about faces would be blown out of the water - and I’m so glad I was right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bringing-the-right-kit&quot;&gt;Bringing the right kit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This certainly won’t be as extensive as my previous NMM post, not least because I would likely be repeating all the excellent things I said last time, and also I sadly didn’t get as many pics… In any case, like last time the class started promptly at 12:00pm at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.badmooncafe.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Bad Moon Cafe&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike last time, at precisely 12:02pm I realised that I had left my wet palette out on the kitchen counter to dry out before transporting it and was thus left palette-less for the day. Fortunately, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/hivecityblues/&quot;&gt;Mo&lt;/a&gt;, one of the other students, kindly lent me his normal palette, and then, like a knight in shining armour &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/fnd_studios_/&quot;&gt;Zak&lt;/a&gt;, who I met at the original class, arrived and let me share some space on his - thanks to you both!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the class, Mamikon had prepped all the heads that we would be painting, once again we all received two bits to try out. To save us time just simply base coating the heads in the same flat colours in the initial steps, everything was pre-base coated in a suitably fleshly colour, so we could jump right into practising the highlighting and shading of the face and get to work bringing the piece to life. I only focussed on one head this time just because there weren’t as many fancy effects I wanted to try out, but more variations of heads for the bitz box is always welcome, and several other people did have a go at both as a ‘practice’ and ‘final’ piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-gateway-to-the-soul&quot;&gt;The Gateway to the soul&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the 6 hour class (including some breaks for lunch and grabbing drinks etc.), we took the entire head from start to finish. Beginning with an initial mid-tone to lighten things up a bit, adding warmth to the recesses and around the eye and accentuating the scars and sharpest features. I’m particularly satisfied with how the eyes came out, and the addition of stubble around the mouth and on top of the head helped balance out the tone and realism of the whole piece. One thing I particularly felt like I learnt more about was approaching how to think about real objects (in this case someone’s skin) and consider which highlights and shades are due to the lighting conditions vs the history of the object such as the age of any scars - it certainly got me thinking more about tone modulation for other areas of painting and I do genuinely think it will have an effect on how I approach minis in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I think the results speak for themselves. They say the face is meant to be the focal point of any mini, but even without a body I keep getting distracted by staring at this tiny head on my desk, proud of the fact that this is something I am capable of. I will likely even stick it onto one of my space marines when I get round to finishing them. While both classes were great, I came out of this one with my mind buzzing about so many ideas for display minis that I have had over the last couple of weeks anyway and this has absolutely given me the confidence to give them a crack (once I’ve at least finished my first squad of Sons of Medusa…).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that I also realised I missed from my days when I would just sit in my local GW painting, was just talking about the hobby with like-minded people while we worked away on our own pieces. As well as the excellent tutelage from Mamikon, everyone in the class was exchanging tips and cheats that helped them with various aspects of the hobby and giving each other feedback on things we were working on as well as our thoughts on the latest competitions and events. It’s a sense of community that I haven’t actively been a part of for a very long time, and it definitely beats sitting at home with a random Netflix show on in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always it has been an absolute pleasure. If you are interested in Mamikon’s work, be sure to keep an eye on his &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MamikonPaints&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/nokipaintingstudio/&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; as that is where you will likely hear about more classes soon!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ollie</name></author><category term="Review" /><summary type="html">So after how much I enjoyed my last class I could hardly say no when I saw Mamikon announce his face painting one.

&lt;p&gt;Impulse purchase definitely isn’t the right word here, but I certainly don’t think I have progressed from seeing something to buying it quite as quickly as when the kickstarter went live for Compendium: Volume 1. Produced by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theminiaturescompendium.com/&quot;&gt;The Miniatures Compendium&lt;/a&gt; and launched on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/miniaturescompendium/compendium-volume-one/description&quot;&gt;kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; back in March 2021, it is clear from start to finish that this is a labour of love. This mighty tome collects Golden Demon winners from over the past 30 years with additional commentary and even works in progress photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you that don’t follow The Miniatures Compendium on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/thegoldendemoncompendium/&quot;&gt;their instagram&lt;/a&gt;, for years it has been an incredible archive of past and present Golden Demon winners, with every person they follow being a Golden Demon winning artist. This volume is a culmination of nearly 4 years of work, covering 94 miniatures from 54 different artists all presented in a gorgeous 320-page hardback volume with additional art by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/orniris/&quot;&gt;Orniris Terensi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going all the way back to 1988, it is super interesting to see how painting styles have evolved and improved as the hobby has grown and its quite a nice trip down memory lane seeing winners that I was able to see back when I went to GamesDay. Each entry is presented over several pages, with brand new high res photography to really capture every detail and every angle of the model that you don’t normally see on websites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://demonwinner.free.fr/&quot;&gt;Demon Winner&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://golden-demon.com/&quot;&gt;Golden Demon&lt;/a&gt;. The incredible resolution and detail in the images also works to make the entries feel so much more attainable - these images are the closest I am going to get to actually holding them in my hands, to the point where you can start to see the brush strokes and how the overall finish is constructed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the miniatures also have an excellent commentary from the artist themselves about the process and story behind the models. Since so many of the entries are often heavily converted its hard to know where us mere mortals could even start by creating such incredible pieces, but understanding the thought process, often alongside an image of the unpainted model further helps to show how skilled a sculptor these people are, and what materials were used. A particular favourite of mine is seeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/iagop_works/&quot;&gt;Iago Pineda’s&lt;/a&gt; 2003 Youngbloods entry followed by his 2004 Slayer Sword winning entry (At the age of 15!) and the process behind how his styles improved and changed over the intervening year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, my absolute highlight is the pictures of Roman Lappat’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://massivevoodoo.blogspot.com/2013/11/the-last-light.html&quot;&gt;The Last Light&lt;/a&gt; diorama that won the 2013 German Slayer Sword. I fell in love with this piece when I saw it on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://massivevoodoo.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Massive Voodoo&lt;/a&gt; blog nearly 8 years ago, and hands down has to be the greatest Slayer Sword winner of all time. It is all in all a great trip down memory lane to see models that I remember reading about in White Dwarf and online. However, it is a bit annoying that the only place that says the year, category and position is in the contents, so I keep needing to flick back and forth to get all the information about the entries as I’m looking. But to be honest it’s really the miniatures themselves that we care about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going all the way up to the most recent Golden Demon competitions in 2019 (hopefully, with a new one soon), I think like many people, the fact that this book is titled “Volume 1” hopefully hints that more are on the way. The kickstarter pledges are still being fulfilled but it looks like this should be completed by the end of November. I’ll admit it is quite cool as a kickstarter backer to have my name listed in the back, and particularly flattering that several people messaged me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/ifthehuefits.blog/&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; thinking my name was there because I had previously won. Unfortunately, I don’t know if additional copies will be available at a later date. I certainly hope so, and if it is then you really must get a copy - even my flatmate and friends who aren’t Warhammer-savvy have had a flick through and marvelled at some of the incredible work on display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing all the high-res pictures makes me want to re-do the images for of my last Golden Demon entry - the 2013 Youngbloods which I did actually get a finalists pin for. However, I think the model is in one of my cases back in Lincolnshire, so perhaps a task for another time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to think (and I certainly hope you would agree) that I’m a fairly good painter, or at least I certainly know my way around a paintbrush. However, one of my main problems with improving my skills is that it’s rare that tutorials and videos that I am watching apply directly to what it is I am trying to do - be it different colours, models or just knowing when to use it. This means that if something ends up not quite how I was expecting, it can make it hard to specifically diagnose whether it’s my technique, the colours I’m using or how I’m actually applying the new skill. For years I’ve wanted to go to painting classes to try and alleviate this issue and also have the chance to talk directly to people that I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; can do what I’m trying to achieve. Unfortunately, due to logistics, cost or more recently a global pandemic I’ve never had a chance - until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been following Mamkion of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/nokipaintingstudio/&quot;&gt;Noki Painting Studio&lt;/a&gt; for a while, so I was really happy to see when he was advertising several different classes over the next few months and jumped at the chance to do his non-metallic metal (NMM) one. Communication beforehand was great, and it was made very clear what materials and tools we would need along with an advised paints list, so with my bags packed, brushes in hand, I jumped on the tube and made my way to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.badmooncafe.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Bad Moon Cafe&lt;/a&gt;, our venue for the six-hour session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit, &lt;em&gt;initially&lt;/em&gt; I was a bit disappointed when I turned up and found out we would be painting swords. Like a walking &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect&quot;&gt;Dunning-Kruger&lt;/a&gt; graph at the peak of Mount Stupid, foolishly I had assumed I knew most of what there was to know about the actual recipes used for non-metallic metal, and was worried that I wouldn’t get as much out of the class as I hoped. What I was hoping to learn was the application, that is, how to take a model (or part thereof) and know where to place the reflections and highlights without having to look at images of work from people that have done NMM on similar models. It turns out that (a) I would learn a lot about application I never realised (b) colour and the application were more linked than I originally thought (c) there is no point trying to run until you’ve mastered how to walk. To strain this metaphor a bit further, I quickly realised all I had done was just put on some shoes and assumed that’s all there was to it, without actually trying to stand up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-slope-of-enlightenment&quot;&gt;The Slope of Enlightenment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, class underway, we begin with a brief chat about the techniques involved and started with a fairly straightforward NMM sword. Mamikon had also prepped a really good sequence of swords which showed full step by step so we knew at least what to aim for or expect at the end of each stage. It was great to get one on one feedback at each of the stages and this was tailored to the different levels of each student. It was particularly helpful to have the confidence that blemishes and mistakes are fine, and in fact, later stages will naturally mask them or they can be turned more into features that make the sword look more battle-worn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

	&lt;img style=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/generated/images/2021-10-17-niko-class/examples-800-409ef0508.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Non-metallic metal swords step-by-step&quot; srcset=&quot;/generated/images/2021-10-17-niko-class/examples-400-409ef0508.jpg 400w, /generated/images/2021-10-17-niko-class/examples-600-409ef0508.jpg 600w, /generated/images/2021-10-17-niko-class/examples-800-409ef0508.jpg 800w, /generated/images/2021-10-17-niko-class/examples-1000-409ef0508.jpg 1000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) calc(100vw-10px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw-25px), (max-width: 1600px) calc(70vw-100px), (min-width: 1601px) calc(75vw-300px)&quot; /&gt;

	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;We used this example set to see how each stage builds on the previous&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the foundation of the ‘standard’ NMM sword ready, we then started adding glazes and what I can best describe as a lens-flare effect - it felt insane to be using red, green and yellow on what was meant to be a silver sword, but honestly, I think the results speak for themselves! With everyone getting two swords each to play with, there was plenty of room for experimentation, and it also meant everyone could go at their own pace and try out multiple styles or just focus on getting one piece looking really great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a quick 45-minute lunch break (which for me was closer to an hour after finding out a nearby store had Imperium magazine #5 in stock with the exclusive captain) we were back and then on to trying gold. This was the part that I was really interested in as we were painting the hand and other features on the sword which had more complex surfaces that interacted with the lights in different ways. Having now done the main blade of the sword I felt much better equipped tackling the other bits of the part (parts of the bit?) that I don’t think I would have been as confident in had we just jumped into complex surfaces. Being able to ask not just what should be done but &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; really helped improve the depth of my understanding and a lot of explanation was done in the context of some incredible display models that were brought along so we could see, for example, how and why you might shift around the reflections on a hand in different scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, I had a really excellent time, and I am so happy with how my sword turned out - Mamikon is an excellent teacher and very patient in answering all my questions. At £80 for six hours, I think this session really was a steal. Everyone else in the class was also really lovely and incredibly supportive of one another. It’s been a long time since I have painted with other people around, and it was great just to have a chat about what sort of projects people are working on, how they find certain tools and paints and just where they are from. Particular shout out to Zak from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/fnd_studios_/&quot;&gt;Faith and Damnation studios&lt;/a&gt; and David at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/diddy_miniatures/&quot;&gt;Diddy Miniatures&lt;/a&gt; for the excellent company and letting me borrow some of their paints, and a very cool vortex mixer.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;Everyone's final pieces&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps my only minor critique (and I do mean minor) would be that it would have been nice if we had a full arm with the sword on which to play around with so that we could try NMM on more shapes and surfaces. However, I very much appreciate that sourcing enough bits for us to paint is likely a pain and, since we pretty much went to time on just the sword and hand, I don’t even know if we would have had time to do more. Overall there was also a really good balance struck to allow the wide range of skill levels to get the most out of the session. I certainly learnt so much more than I was expecting and I’m looking forward to trying this out on characters and other special models in the future to build my confidence further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe there are several more classes planned on basing and faces with Mamikon so if you are interested in getting some classes with him (which I heartily recommend), feel free to message him on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/nokipaintingstudio/&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MamikonPaints&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. I definitely know that now I have the itch I want to get involved in many more classes where I can over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for such a great day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: I finally have my Space Marine chapter decided, I just need help with the greens…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I’m still here. I tried to start this site with a lot of gusto in the hope that it would give me the motivation to get projects finished and share it with you all. Alas, it has not materialised in the way I hoped, BUT I think finally I can really get started in earnest with the Space Marines I have been trying to get painted over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone that has been following my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/ifthehuefits.blog/&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; over the last year will have seen various intermittent posts as I try every possible permutation of colours I liked under the son for my Primaris marines. Originally I wanted to do something akin to Sons of the Phoenix, but with black armour and a green arm, then I decided that I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; liked the Jade colour made by Kabalite green so wanted that to be my main colour with some other secondary arm but something still wasn’t quite clicking how I hoped. I was ideally looking for some sort of homebrew chapter that would give me enough scope for conversions, certainly not a mainstream chapter at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, quite by accident, I stumbled across Richard Walker’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CRmB3PEIJez/&quot;&gt;Sons of Medusa&lt;/a&gt; the tutorial for which can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/siegestudios&quot;&gt;Siege Studio’s patreon&lt;/a&gt;. I had never come across them before so started having a look at the lore and background online. For those uninitiated, the Sons of Medusa are an Iron Hands successor chapter, specifically three of the Iron Hands clans that splintered off to form their own chapter. While most armies I see online show them as a lime green similar to Salamanders, &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; their armour is described as emerald in the lore, and that was absolutely the colour I wanted to do mine. So that’s it, right? I just use the jade/emerald colour I used in my original test models and move on right? WRONG! I discovered actually that Kabalite green was just that bit too dark that I didn’t think there was enough contrast between the black and the rest of the armour. The search was narrowed, but it does still continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pick-your-fighter&quot;&gt;Pick your fighter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I bit the bullet, and rather than stripping and repainting the same 5 space marines over and over, I figured I would finally just try painting a Primaris marine, three in fact! So I need input: forget what the Sons of Medusa &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; look like, and instead just tell me which green you prefer. In the image at the start of this post, from left to right we have VMC Emerald, VMC Park Green Flat and VGC Jade. I think they all have their merits, and it’s particularly hard for me to decide. I think the Emerald and Jade are very similar anyway and think that the Jade is just a bit richer, but Park Green v Jade is the toughy. That said, I am really happy with all of them, and may even go as far as to say they are some of the best minis I’ve painted - lockdown has given me a long time to watch painting videos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some still minor details that I want to sort with the colours, in particular the colour of the chest Aquila, and I might play around with the tone of the heads a bit more. Finally, there are the transfers to add as well, along with the black knee caps, but I don’t think that will massively affect anyone’s preference so I’ve left it for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;emerald&quot;&gt;Emerald&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also been trying to refine my miniature photography a bit too to try and improve the quality of the images. Annoyingly I haven’t been able to hit the sweet spot with the colour correction so my physical favourite (by a slim margin) is not the same as my favourite picked straight from the images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, let me know your thoughts, I’ll be putting various polls up on all the socials over the next week so tell me what you think, and hopefully, soon you’ll see a whole squad. Once I’ve settled on the scheme and got a few more done, I will eventually get round to putting a tutorial together for them too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ollie</name></author><category term="Showcase" /><summary type="html">TLDR: I finally have my Space Marine chapter decided, I just need help with the greens… Yes, I’m still here. I tried to start this site with a lot of gusto in the hope that it would give me the motivation to get projects finished and share it with you all. Alas, it has not materialised in the way I hoped, BUT I think finally I can really get started in earnest with the Space Marines I have been trying to get painted over the last year.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Han &amp;amp; Leia</title><link href="https://ifthehuefits.github.io//showcase/2021/01/05/han-leia.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Han &amp;amp; Leia" /><published>2021-01-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-01-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ifthehuefits.github.io//showcase/2021/01/05/han-leia</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifthehuefits.github.io//showcase/2021/01/05/han-leia.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/generated/images/2021-01-05-han-leia/hanleia2-800-e72d764f5.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/generated/images/2021-01-05-han-leia/hanleia2-400-e72d764f5.jpg 400w, /generated/images/2021-01-05-han-leia/hanleia2-600-e72d764f5.jpg 600w, /generated/images/2021-01-05-han-leia/hanleia2-800-e72d764f5.jpg 800w, /generated/images/2021-01-05-han-leia/hanleia2-1000-e72d764f5.jpg 1000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) calc(100vw-10px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw-25px), (max-width: 1600px) calc(70vw-100px), (min-width: 1601px) calc(75vw-300px)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boy, it feels good to be painting again. Having not picked up a brush since moving to London in September these busts have been a real joy to paint. Sculpted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/reubenlowde/&quot;&gt;Reuben Lowde&lt;/a&gt;, these resin cast Han and Leia busts are available now on his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/ReubenLowdeArt?ref=ss_profilei&quot;&gt;Etsy store&lt;/a&gt; - Reuben very kindly sent me through a pair to paint up for him. This has been the first time I’ve painted something that isn’t a 28mm scale miniature so it’s been a real learning curve, but an incredibly useful one. What was so surprising about the jump to larger-scale was how I found the blending easier? I was expecting with more space the steps would be more obvious, but in fact, having more surface to work with made it easier to get a consistent colour gradient.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I didn’t plan ahead and take pictures of every stage but hopefully, the descriptions below should be useful. In any case, it would be great to know your thoughts and any feedback on the formats of these articles - drop your comments below or get in touch on any of my socials!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prep&quot;&gt;Prep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I have ever tried zenithal priming, and I’m not gonna lie, once I did it I kind of wanted to just leave it as it is. There is something about all the shading that it naturally applies that I find fascinating. I don’t know if I made use of it the best I could since I largely just basecoated over the top of it, but these pictures I took before I did anything else really helped to guide me with shadow placements as I hadn’t really thought about lighting in this much detail before.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Kislev Flesh&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flayed One Flesh&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ogryn Flesh wash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for Han, starting with a flat base of Bugman’s Glow, I then slowly layered up to Kislev flesh, keeping the paints really thin to glaze them over the areas I wanted to highlight. I usually created a mid-tone between each layer with a 50:50 mix of the darker or lighter paint. For areas that needed darkening down a little bit, particularly the recesses around the nose and eyes, I added in a small amount of screamer pink to the Bugman’s glow for Han, and Doombull brown for Leia. I then took some really thinned down Flayed One flesh to pick out the places the light would hit such as the side of the nose, and forehead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lips, I used a thinned down version of the shading colour and glazed that over, I was pleasantly surprised how nice the tone that produced was! Finally, to add a little bit more contrast and warmth to the cheeks, I applied a thin layer of water over the cheek area, and then just glazed some Ogryn flesh into the lower regions. The water all over helps to allow the wash to diffuse a little bit and reduce tide marks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a slightly different approach for Leia generally. I still started with Bugmans Glow and layered up to Cadian fleshtone. This time though, now I had done it once I wanted to play a bit more with directional lighting. I added a very small amount of black to the Cadian Fleshtone to de-saturate it a bit and used that in areas not directly exposed to the light. I then highlighted this area with a bit of white added to the mix. I think it worked quite well and the directional lighting is certainly visible on the model, but next time I think I could exaggerate it a little further to make it more obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:250px&quot; src=&quot;/generated/images/2021-01-05-han-leia/skin-800-5d7045ce6.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/generated/images/2021-01-05-han-leia/skin-400-5d7045ce6.jpg 400w, /generated/images/2021-01-05-han-leia/skin-600-5d7045ce6.jpg 600w, /generated/images/2021-01-05-han-leia/skin-800-5d7045ce6.jpg 800w, /generated/images/2021-01-05-han-leia/skin-1000-5d7045ce6.jpg 1000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) calc(100vw-10px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw-25px), (max-width: 1600px) calc(70vw-100px), (min-width: 1601px) calc(75vw-300px)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hair&quot;&gt;Hair&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hair was done in the same way for both busts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rhinox Hide&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mournfang Brown&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leather Brown (Vallejo)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agrax Earthshade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like with the skin I worked up from darkest to lightest mixing a mid-tone between each step. Make sure to keep the paint really thin and have patience with each layer to build up the smooth gradient. While washes don’t normally work as well on large scale features, the hair still has a lot of texture, so I applied a thin all over wash to the hair, being slightly heavier towards the bottom of the hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I applied a light drybrush of Rhinox Hide to the darker areas and Leather Brown to the lighter areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hans-jacket&quot;&gt;Han’s Jacket&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am really happy with this, Corvus Black is probably my favourite colour right now. It’s just enough off-black that there is room for it to be darkened without it looking grey overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Abaddon black&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Corvus black&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eshin grey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dawnstone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adiminstratum grey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with Corvus black base, I took a really thin Abaddon black into the areas I wanted to shade. I used this instead of a wash or contrast because you can eventually reach 100% opacity with the acrylic paint vs a wash. I also really liked the slight satin finish of Abaddon black, particularly for the leather jacket. To maximise the contrast, the darkest areas of black would be highlighted right next to it with the lighter greys, as with previous working up with mixed mid-tones and thin glazes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At about the dawnstone level, I added a couple of small scratches to the leather to give it a bit more texture and aged look. Some of these were then also highlighted with Adiminstratum grey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, to blend it all together I did a thin glaze of Abaddon black all over to tie together all the highlights a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hans-shirt&quot;&gt;Han’s Shirt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Celestra Grey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ulthuan grey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ushabti Bone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Zandri Dust&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Khemri Brown (Old GW)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;White Scar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A base of Celestra grey was used to make it easier to layer up to a pure basecoat of Ulthuan grey. Then using the brown tones I shaded down to the darkest, before highlighting the edges with pure white scar to make the edges pop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there were more purples and browns in Han’s skin tone I thought it was important to make sure the shirt had an overall warm tone to it too. As you can see I took a slightly different approach to Leia’s shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;leias-jacket&quot;&gt;Leia’s Jacket&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Zandri Dust&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ushabti Bone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Screaming Skull&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Khemri Brown (Old GW)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agrax Earthshade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working from a flat basecoat I layered up to pure Screaming Skull, carefully glazing to get the smooth transition up to the highlights. Kemri brown was then used to darken the recesses. Zandri dust and Khemri Brown are quite close so I didn’t bother with an intermediate mix. Instead, I wetted the area as I did with the skin, I then glazed the darkest recesses with Agrax Earthshade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;leias-shirt&quot;&gt;Leia’s Shirt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thunderhawk blue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fenrisian Grey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Celestra Grey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ulthuan grey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;White Scar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like with Han’s shirt, Leia’s I worked up to a pure Ulthuan Grey basecoat and then shaded down through Celestra Grey and Fenrisian Grey. A small amount of Thunderhawk blue was then shaded into the deep recesses. Finally, highlight back up to White scar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;eyes&quot;&gt;Eyes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ulthuan Grey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mournfang Brown/ Castellan Green&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leather Brown (Vallejo)/ Loren Forest&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;White scar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to start with an off white for eyes as it gives room for the specular reflections to pop. I kept a thin dark pink line in the shadow between the whites and the eyelids to keep them separated. Then starting with the darkest green or brown I slowly highlighted up the iris like a gem - keeping the highlights only in the bottom corner. Finally, add the specular reflection in the opposite upper corner. For the final touch add a small amount of gloss varnish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m really proud of these models and it gave me the time to try out techniques and styles that I haven’t touched before on tabletop minis. I was able to play around with cold vs light contrasts, particularly with the shirts, as well as how to create texture on surfaces. I thought I would be painting these as a one-off, but I have to admit now I have the itch to try larger-scale pieces I would definitely be interested in getting some more busts to work with. If you like the look of these be sure to check out Reuben’s Etsy shop to get your own!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ollie</name></author><category term="Showcase" /><summary type="html">Boy, it feels good to be painting again. Having not picked up a brush since moving to London in September these busts have been a real joy to paint. Sculpted by Reuben Lowde, these resin cast Han and Leia busts are available now on his Etsy store - Reuben very kindly sent me through a pair to paint up for him. This has been the first time I’ve painted something that isn’t a 28mm scale miniature so it’s been a real learning curve, but an incredibly useful one. What was so surprising about the jump to larger-scale was how I found the blending easier? I was expecting with more space the steps would be more obvious, but in fact, having more surface to work with made it easier to get a consistent colour gradient.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Is This Thing On?</title><link href="https://ifthehuefits.github.io//editorial/2020/11/24/is-this-thing-on.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Is This Thing On?" /><published>2020-11-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-11-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ifthehuefits.github.io//editorial/2020/11/24/is-this-thing-on</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ifthehuefits.github.io//editorial/2020/11/24/is-this-thing-on.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/generated/images/warhammer/canoptek_spyder_4-800-9b47eee6b.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/generated/images/warhammer/canoptek_spyder_4-400-9b47eee6b.jpg 400w, /generated/images/warhammer/canoptek_spyder_4-600-9b47eee6b.jpg 600w, /generated/images/warhammer/canoptek_spyder_4-800-9b47eee6b.jpg 800w, /generated/images/warhammer/canoptek_spyder_4-1000-9b47eee6b.jpg 1000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 500px) calc(100vw-10px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw-25px), (max-width: 1600px) calc(70vw-100px), (min-width: 1601px) calc(75vw-300px)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well hey there, thanks for dropping in, and welcome to the inaugural post on If the Hue Fits! I’m Ollie the blog’s creator and I hope this site can act as a repository not only for my own ideas and projects but hopefully as inspiration and guidance for yours. I hold no illusions of being a professional painter, but I like to think I can get together a decent enough model that it might be worth sharing with other people and talk about how I did it - in a similar vibe to the great people at &lt;a href=&quot;https://taleofpainters.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Tale of Painters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-i-expect&quot;&gt;What can I expect?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this blog will contain a myriad of articles that might pique your interest, including (but not limited too):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Works in Progress/ Showcases of my latest projects to help give me the motivation to reduce my pile of shame.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tutorials on certain models that you guys like, or things that I know I struggled with when I was first starting out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reviews, not necessarily on anything newly released, but on anything I may have bought without knowing much about it in the hope it may help you avoid making the same mistakes or promote great new discoveries!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Editorials, or just random articles on anything from what may be in my painting box, updates to the website or great gaming discoveries that I have found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If those things sound up your street then stick around, follow me on the socials and I look forward to going on this journey with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S The Gallery is looking a bit empty right now, but hopefully, as I start to post more showcases and reasonable quality photography it should start to fill up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;okay-sure-but-what-sort-of-stuff-do-you-actually-do&quot;&gt;Okay sure, but what sort of stuff do you actually do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I’ve collected Warhammer since 2005, only learnt how to play in 2011 and been much more focussed on painting since about 2015. My very first army was Chaos Space Marines, but you won’t see much of those since I very swiftly moved onto Necrons. I’m pretty happy with my Necron force but there is an itch with Indomitus to try and change the look since they are based on a scheme from the original 3rd edition codex. In terms of AoS/ Warhammer Fantasy, I have a steadily growing Tomb Kings army (can you sense a recurring theme?) which while isn’t directly gaining models, does constitute a significant part of my pile of shame. Some friends of mine a few years ago got me the Betrayal at Calth box also with the intent I do (you guessed it) Thousand Sons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a smattering of Tau that will appear every now and then, which I have been collecting since 2015, so all in all a nice range of stuff in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-next&quot;&gt;And Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So things may be a bit quiet for now just while I work the kinks out of this website, as I very much taught myself web-dev so I could make this. Currently, with Indomitus, I am making my first foray into the Adeptus Astartes so I may be needing some help with some test themes coming up, I’m also hopefully starting work on some busts by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/reubenlowde/&quot;&gt;Reuben Lowde&lt;/a&gt; which you should definitely check out also. In the meantime, enjoy the cheeky smattering of Necrons currently scattered across here and the gallery.&lt;/p&gt;
