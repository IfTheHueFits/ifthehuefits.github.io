Well hey there, thanks for dropping in, and welcome to the inaugural post on If the Hue Fits! I'm Ollie the blog's creator and I hope this site can act as a repository not only for my own ideas and projects but hopefully as inspiration and guidance for yours. I hold no illusions of being a professional painter, but I like to think I can get together a decent enough model that it might be worth sharing with other people and talk about how I did it - in a similar vibe to the great people at [Tale of Painters](https://taleofpainters.blogspot.com/).

## What can I expect?

Hopefully, this blog will contain a myriad of articles that might pique your interest, including (but not limited too):

- Works in Progress/ Showcases of my latest projects to help give me the motivation to reduce my pile of shame.
- Tutorials on certain models that you guys like, or things that I know I struggled with when I was first starting out.
- Reviews, not necessarily on anything newly released, but on anything I may have bought without knowing much about it in the hope it may help you avoid making the same mistakes or promote great new discoveries!
- Editorials, or just random articles on anything from what may be in my painting box, updates to the website or great gaming discoveries that I have found.

If those things sound up your street then stick around, follow me on the socials and I look forward to going on this journey with you.

P.S The Gallery is looking a bit empty right now, but hopefully, as I start to post more showcases and reasonable quality photography it should start to fill up.

## Okay sure, but what sort of stuff do you actually do?

Well, I've collected Warhammer since 2005, only learnt how to play in 2011 and been much more focussed on painting since about 2015. My very first army was Chaos Space Marines, but you won't see much of those since I very swiftly moved onto Necrons. I'm pretty happy with my Necron force but there is an itch with Indomitus to try and change the look since they are based on a scheme from the original 3rd edition codex. In terms of AoS/ Warhammer Fantasy, I have a steadily growing Tomb Kings army (can you sense a recurring theme?) which while isn't directly gaining models, does constitute a significant part of my pile of shame. Some friends of mine a few years ago got me the Betrayal at Calth box also with the intent I do (you guessed it) Thousand Sons.

There is also a smattering of Tau that will appear every now and then, which I have been collecting since 2015, so all in all a nice range of stuff in my opinion.

## And Next?

So things may be a bit quiet for now just while I work the kinks out of this website, as I very much taught myself web-dev so I could make this. Currently, with Indomitus, I am making my first foray into the Adeptus Astartes so I may be needing some help with some test themes coming up, I'm also hopefully starting work on some busts by [Reuben Lowde](https://www.instagram.com/reubenlowde/) which you should definitely check out also. In the meantime, enjoy the cheeky smattering of Necrons currently scattered across here and the gallery.
